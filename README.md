- (a). General description:
    - The current capstone implements the option 1, i.e. build a project of my choice
        - Goal:
            - Implement a template for C++ gRPC service, where the client is able to launch
              a new thread for each request, and uses futures/promises to get the answer back
            - Learn to integrate a third party tool (GRPC here) and become more fluent defining
              and using the CMake configuration file

- (b). Prerequisites:
    - It needs GRPC to work:
        - More about it:
            - https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/cpp
        - Instructions to install on the Udacity's workspace:
            - 1. Install gRPC:
                - cd /home/worspace
                - git clone --recurse-submodules -b v1.28.1 https://github.com/grpc/grpc
                - cd grpc
                - mkdir -p cmake/build
                - cd cmake/build
                - cmake -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_INSTALL_DIR ../..
                - make -j4
                - make install
            - 2. Make sure that the 'protoc' version matches the 'Protobuf' version:
                - cd /home/worspace
                - mkdir prot
                - cd prot
                - wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.11.2/protoc-3.11.2-linux-x86_64.zip
                    - It downloads a version of 'protoc' that is compatible with the 'Protobuf' version installed when
                      GRPC was installed:
                        - If the versions are not compatible, then the build will fail
                - unzip protoc-3.11.2-linux-x86_64.zip
                - which protoc
                    - It gives the folder where the current 'protoc' binary is located (call it FOLDER_PATH)
                - cp bin/protoc FOLDER_PATH
                    - Answer 'yes' to replace the current version
                    - It copies the new binary to the folder FOLDER_PATH
                - protoc --version
                    - It must be 3.11.2

- (e). Rubric points addressed:
    - Loops, Functions, I/O:
        - 1. The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures:
            - 'src/grpc_server.cpp':
                - Line 33: control structure
                    - Line 24 and Line 44: code organized around function (and classes) 
            - 'src/grpc_client.cpp':
                - Line 45 and Line 61: control structure
                - Line 24: code organized around function (and classes)
    - Object Oriented Programming:
        - 2. The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, 
             and class methods to perform tasks:
            - 'src/grpc_server.hpp':
                - Line 20: Class definition with the above requirements
                - 'src/grpc_client.hpp':
                    - Line 20: Class definition with the above requirements
        - 3. Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members:
            - 'src/grpc_server.hpp':
                - Line 20: Class definition with the above requirements
                    - 'src/grpc_client.hpp':
                        - Line 20: Class definition with the above requirements
        - 4. Class constructors utilize member initialization lists:
               - 'src/grpc_client.hpp':
                   - Line 24: member initialization list
        - 5. Derived class functions override virtual base class functions:
            - 'src/grpc_server.hpp':
                - Line 24: override virtual method
    - Concurrency:
        - 6. The project uses multithreading:
            - 'src/grpc_client.cpp':
                - Line 97: the project uses multiple threads in the execution (main thread and worker thread)
        - 7. A promise and future is used in the project:
            - 'src/grpc_client.cpp':
                - Line 92, Line 93, Line 97 and Line 101: A promise and future is used to pass data
